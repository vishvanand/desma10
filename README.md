Desma 10: Home of the future - Visualization
---------------------------

Created by team Design Driven Directors

We built a lowpoly 3D model of our home and decided to use an existing webgl setup to display our
idea. Notice the sloping solar powered roofs, the houses on top of floating islands with larger
buildings like 'royce hall' still on the ground.
